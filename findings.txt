As far as I understand, containers do not innately have access to many things 
on the host machine, but can be granted access to with ports, sockets and the like. 
This was done in the task, as I think it's not possible without using some kind of tool.
I researched a little bit that the containers do share the kernel of the host machine, but 
are still isolated.
