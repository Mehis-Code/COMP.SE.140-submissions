For this task, I utilized Copilot as assistance in some parts to help me get pointed
in the right direction if I got really stuck on something (this happened), and for
some very weird formatting tricks for the process commands. The motivation was to
save time in writing tricky solutions for formatting. Those kinds of manual tasks can fill up a lot of time,
which I believe is not the learning goal for these kinds of exercises. I did however,
manually comment the code, and work to understand it. Llm tools would often be useful for commenting,
but I didn't use it here for that.
A downside for llm is that the solutions are often, and in this case quite
bad. There must be a lot better of a way to format the outputs of the ps command and such cases
Also, some of the answers often clash with other parts of the code, which can cause trouble,
like using two tools instead of using one tool's methods to work out the situation,
or so on.
